                    <p class="h4 l5 mb-6">Chef Tutak's culinary journey began with professional education at Bolu Mengen Culinary School, followed by an apprenticeship under the renowned Paul Pairet in Turkey. To expand his expertise he worked in China's prominent port cities Qingdao, Beijing, and Hong Kong, before contributing to the kitchen of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. Tutak would further hone his skills at the 3-Michelin-starred Nihonryori Ryugin in Tokyo under Chef Seiji Yamamoto and work alongside Chef Rene Redzepi at Noma in Copenhagen, which has consistently topped international rankings.</p>
                    <p class="h4 l5 mb-6">In 2015, Tutak took on the role of Head Chef at The Dining Room of The House of Sathorn in Bangkok, later becoming the Director of Culinary Operations. The restaurant gained international acclaim, securing positions in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants (No.36 in 2017 & No.43 in 2018) and receiving a Michelin plate in the Michelin Guide Thailand 2018-19.</p>
                    <p class="h4 l5 mb-6">Notably, Chef Fatih Tutak introduced a menu based on Turkish cuisine at The Dining Room of The House of Sathorn. A signature dish was his reinterpretation of a Turkish manti called ‘For my Mom’.</p>
                    <p class="h4 l5 mb-6">Returning to Türkiye in December 2019, Fatih Tutak fulfilled his long-held dream of opening a restaurant in his home city - TURK Fatih Tutak. The establishment obtained two Michelin stars in the first year of the Michelin Guide in Türkiye, retaining the accolade also in the 2024 ceremony.  The establishment has quickly earned its place among the culinary elite thus cementing Chef Fatih Tutak's status as a prominent figure in the global gastronomic scene.</p>
